## Introduction 

Inspired by [Mesquida et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.220946), this submission brings to life one of their key methodological concerns, publication bias, through targeted data simulation and visualization. Rather than just describing the issue, I aimed to show how it looks, using a funnel plot and a raincloud plot to expose how selective reporting inflates effect sizes and distorts the scientific record. JASP made it easy to create publication-quality graphs that communicate complex patterns with clarity and immediacy. This visual approach turns a methodological point into something tangible, a visual approach that speaks for itself and could deserve recognition for what it makes visible.
